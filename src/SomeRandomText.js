            So, here goes my journey-
I was certain of one thing that I did not wish to apply for an academic internship. Till the end of my sophomore year, neither did I have any internship experience or significant project work in any particular profile nor did I have a specific interest, based on which I could take any decision (Though I would recommend if you can find an internship through LinkedIn or some connections it would definitely help you in making better choices). So I was among the majority club of students who were not really sure about which profile they wish to apply for. But this is not what I thought at that time. I had several friends who were very confident about their preferences, and their preparation was precise (which is a great thing anyway, you can give yourself a pat !). I was anxious about my uncertain choices. But seriously, trust me, this is the situation of most of your companions, and there is nothing to worry about. Just focus on your preparation, and you would sail through the internship process smoothly :)

What I knew at that time was I like Competitive Coding (I did ESO207 in my third sem and continued little bit of coding in my fourth sem), I really enjoyed the course HSO201 (Applied Probability & Statistics), and I was developing interest in Finance (I did Financial Economics Course in summers). So I decided to apply to almost all the companies open for our department in the profile preference order :
Data Analyst/Quantitative Analysis Finance/Business Analyst
Also, my branch did not allow me to prioritize among companies. So that wasn't a callous decision to make. But if you have that luxury, do not apply for everything! Avoid applying for your least preferred profiles.

Now let's come to the preparation part. The first obstacle you need to clear is the company's test and get shortlisted for the interview. I would talk about it first. I'll come to the interview preparation later on.

Preparation for Tests
I talked to a lot of seniors (Talking helps a lot!!). I went through the Internship Insights on the SPO website. You may also check it once and see what all was asked in the tests and interviews of companies you are targeting. So mainly, my preparation consisted of Competitive Coding, probability related questions, and puzzles. These form the major portions of the tests. Some companies also included sections of data science, aptitude tests, Machine Learning, Case Study, and language proficiency.

Coding: To achieve proficiency in coding, practice & consistency is the key! I was a part of the Microsoft CODESS program. They gave us a few coding assignments, which helped me revise my concepts of ESC101 & ESO207. I sincerely started coding daily in July. I would recommend InterviewBit for coding. Almost all companies test your coding skills. So if someone is planning to skip the coding part entirely, please don't do that! Even profiles other than Software Development have the coding section to test your basic coding skills.
One thing I would like to stress upon is practice implementing the code within a time limit. I was also advised the same, but I didn't take it seriously and had to regret it later. Basically, you won't find extremely difficult questions in tests. The challenge is to run your code within the specified time. So do practice that!

Quant: For the quant part, I mainly solved 50 Challenging Problems in Probability and puzzles from Brainstellar. There are some common problems which often repeat in the tests, make sure you know them. In the Goldman Sachs test, 3 out of 8 or 10 (I don't remember) quant questions were known to me. In JP Morgan's interview, I was asked an alteration of one of the problems in 50 CP.

Finance: Although most companies don't expect knowledge of Finance, its always better to have some prior knowledge if you're applying in investment banks or financial firms. Investopedia and Varcity are some of the sites which you may refer to.

I did not prepare much for the Mental ability and data science part as I was pretty confident about them. And I think I did reasonably well in the tests as well. You may practice some mock tests to boost up your confidence and speed.

Resume making: Most of the blogs have already covered this part really well. From my side, I would suggest get it proofread by at least 4-5 seniors and make changes accordingly. Also, make separate resumes for different profiles if you have enough content (I didn't have much, so I used two resumes only)

Here comes the real struggle!
In my case, clearing tests and getting shortlisted was not the toughest part. The interviews were! And here comes the most adventurous, and probably, I should say the most frustrating part as well of the internship season. But, honestly, once you would land up in a good company, every effort would be worth it. I was one of those people who had to face a large number of rejections before finally getting an intern. Okay, that might sound scary, it's not that getting an intern at first shot is difficult, I guess I wasn't well prepared & I made a lot of mistakes that could have been avoided. I am not going in too much detail of what exactly was asked in each of the interviews (you may dm me if you wish to know). I would briefly try to include the dos and don'ts for the interviews. I hope you guys would learn something from my mistakes and refrain from repeating them.

So, I was shortlisted for 4 companies in the first two days of the internship season. Deutsche Bank, Microsoft, and Gartner on Day 1 (Microsoft was not open for the Eco department, I was eligible for the interview through the CODESS program) and American Express on Day 2.

So, how did I prepar</p></div>
